### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

See some useful code snippets that I learned early below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, I recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I am in the process of learning to use the REACT library

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.codepen.io) - This helped me to create code CSS files more easily. I really liked this front-end tool and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.codecademy.com) - This is an amazing online coding school which helped me finally understand HTML, CSS and SCSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning these concepts.
